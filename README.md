# âœ¨ Features

- **Smooth Expanding Animation**  
  Cells smoothly transition between expanded and folded states.  
- **Easy to Use**  
  Simply inherit `ExpandableCell`, register it in `ExpandableCellCollectionView`, and set up your data source.

## ðŸ“± Portrait Mode Recommended
- This library is optimized for apps that support only portrait mode. Unexpected layout issues may occur if the collection view is visible when the device rotates.

## Other Features  
- Currently optimized for vertical scrolling with a single-column layout.

# ðŸš€ How to Use

## 1. Define a custom cell by inheriting `ExpandableCell`
- Instead of using `contentView` directly, use `mainContentView` and `detailContentView` when configuring view hierarchy.
  - Add content that should remain visible when the cell is folded as a subview of `mainContentView` in ExpandableCell.
  - Add content that should only be visible when expanded and hidden when folded as a subview of `detailContentView`.
- The width of `ExpandableCell` is automatically set based on the width of collection view and the specified insets.

``` swift
import UIKit
import ExpandableCell

class MyExpandableCell: ExpandableCell {
    // Properties
    let titleLabel = UILabel()
    let descriptionLabel = UILabel()

    override init(frame: CGRect) {
        super.init(frame: .zero)

        // setting View Hierarchy
        mainContentView.addSubview(titleLabel)
        detailContentView.addSubview(descriptionLabel)

        // setting contents' properties...
        // setting contents' layout...
    }

    func configure(with data: DataModel) {
        // configure cell's contents...
    }
}
```

## 2.ExpandableCellCollectionView 
  is a custom collection view that provides expand/collapse interaction when tapping on cells. It is designed to be simple and easy to integrate without relying on a separate view controller.
- You can either instantiate `ExpandableCellCollectionView` directly or subclass it for more customization.
- When registering cells with this collection view, only cells of type `ExpandableCell` are allowed.
- `ExpandableCellCollectionView` assigns itself as the collection viewâ€™s delegate to handle tap-to-expand/collapse interactions.
  Do not manually assign a different `delegate` to this view.
  If you need to implement additional behavior related to `UICollectionViewDelegate` or `UIScrollViewDelegate`,
  subclass `ExpandableCellCollectionView` and implement the appropriate delegate methods there.
